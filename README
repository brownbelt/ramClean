How to make it work.
-On startup a service load a kernel image with a built in initram on ram
-When the sd card is removed, a udev rule is triggered and kexec load the new kernel that was previously loaded on ram.
-The PC no boot our modded kernel, sdmem is triggered and starts to clean all ram
-Finaly when the job is done. your computer poweroff.


depends on: kexec


Instructions:
create a direcory in /etc
  mkdir /etc/ramclean 

copy ramzadas to /etc/ramclean
  cp -r ramzadas /etc/ramclean

(if you dont want to compile the kernel just do "cp vmlinuz /etc/ramclean/vmlinuz" and go to line 30)  
Download linux source... any kernel will be acceptable
copy config to the kernel source
  cp config /usr/src/linux

compile the kernel with the config  (for maximum power do, make -j8)
  cd /usr/src/linux
  make -j8
    the kernel will build with no modules and builtin initramfs
copy compiled kernel to /etc/ramclean
  cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /etc/ramclean/vmlinuz

plug sd card and change the follow udev rule to match with your device
  copy 11-ramclean.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/

copy ramclean.service to systemd services
  cp ramclean.service /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
enable the service
  systemctl enable ramclean
start the service
  systemctl start ramclean
  
Now try to remove your device and see what happens
